        <p>	I have been in a Technical management and architecture role for various years now and have a hands-on experience with a variety of industries, technologies and platforms. I have also successfully delivered some high traffic inventory systems:

          I have always delivered with focus on aligning IT strategy with company vision, employees and clients. In addition to my current experience, I have consistently driven teams to deliver a very high quality product within stringent time and budget constraints. I can also master new technologies very quickly and love new challenges. I have an excellent success record on all projects I have worked on and have excellent recommendations from my past experiences in various projects.

        <h3>Micro service transformation</h3>
        <h6>Technical Architect</h6>
        <p>Defined an architecture that structures the application as a set of loosely coupled, collaborating services. Highly maintainable and testable - enabled rapid and frequent development and deployment.Capable of being developed by a small team - essential for high productivity by avoiding the high communication head of large teams.Services communicate using either synchronous protocols such as HTTP/REST or asynchronous through Kafka ( Event Driven Architecture). Services developed and deployed independently of one another (Using Domain Driven Design). Each service has its own database in order to be decoupled from other services.</p>

        <h3>SOA Tranformation</h3>
        <h6>Technical Architect</h6>
        <p>Project was to tranform all legacy services to be transformed to SOA APIs.Different services  used in conjunction to provide the functionality of a large inventory application.It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components communication. Allowed users to combine a large number of facilities from existing services to form applications.applications were made from existing services.Thus, services can be reused to make many applications.
          This project helped client by creating interoperability between apps and services. This also ensured existing applications can be easily scaled, while simultaneously reducing costs related to the development of business service solutions. </p>

        <h3>Global Computing Platform </h3>
        <h6>Technical lead</h6>
        <p>This system collects data across various applications and provides a centralized repository for ATTs corporate data. The system is inherently complex in that it deals with several applications across several platforms and involves several tools and technologies.
          It is the next generation Enterprise system fabric which Supports Application Services and Data Services. Enterprise Data Fabric is a centralized Database Repository where client Interface Application uses the platform as common place for sending and receiving data through API/Micro Services/Web Services.        </p>
